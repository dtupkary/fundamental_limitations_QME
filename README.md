# fundamental_limitations_QME
Code for studying quantum master equations, used for https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.12091, https://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.105.032208.

This repo is not well documented and was created a long time after the code was written. For questions, please reach out to me, and I will do my best to get back to you.
